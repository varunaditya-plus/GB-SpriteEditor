# Gameboy Sprite Editor

This is a **pixelart editor**, made with the primary purpose to be used for gameboy game sprites.

This project is a recreation of [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/), but with specific features meant for making Game Boy</br>
Color games. It is the only pixel art editor (to my knowledge) with support for the 15-bit colorspace

<h2>✰ About</h2>
Currently, I am working on making a Game Boy Color game using GBDK-2020, but I keep running into issues as the art for my game is made in the normal RGB color space, using Piskel, which is not the same color space as the extremely limited 15-bit colorspace, with only 32,768 colors in total. I couldn't find an editor with a nice ui and tools to make art for the Game Boy, so I don't even know how the actual games were made, but I just decided to make my own editor.
